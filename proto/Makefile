# TODO(roy): These are currently not used. Clean this up when moving dydxjs and dydxpy.
# dydxjs needs cosmos protos that aren't depended on by dydx protos.
# Running the export command above will only get a subset of cosmos protos.
# For now, we will export cosmos protos separately. Note that this doesn't verify the digest.
# TODO(DEC-2027): Do this in a more reproducible way.
