// - Stateful cancellations order IDs that were placed in the last block.
// - Stateful order IDs forcefully removed in the last block.
// - Conditional order IDs triggered in the last block.
// - Conditional order IDs placed, but not triggered in the last block.
// - The height of the block in which the events occurred.
