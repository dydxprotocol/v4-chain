The dYdX v4 software (the ”dYdX Chain”) is a sovereign blockchain software built using Cosmos SDK and CometBFT. It powers a robust decentralized perpetual futures exchange with a high-performance orderbook and matching engine for a feature-rich, self-custodial perpetual trading experience on any market.

This repository contains the source code for the Cosmos SDK application responsible for running the chain and the associated indexer services. The indexer services are a read-only layer that indexes on-chain and off-chain data from a node and serves it to users in a more performant and user-friendly way.
