# Rust crate for dYdX Chain protobufs

## Usage as a dependency

Cargo.toml

```toml
[dependencies]
dydx-proto = "0.4.0"
```

*Note:* by default, rust stub files are not rebuilt (see Q&A below)

For more idiomatic Rust you can use conversions (`try_into` and `into`) for the following types:
* `prost_types::Timestamp` -> `std::time::SystemTime`
* `prost_types::Duration`-> `std::time::Duration`

## Local development

### Prerequisites
1) [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
2) [Buf](https://github.com/bufbuild/buf?tab=readme-ov-file#installation) - to resolve 3rd-party dependencies for protobuf files
3) [protoc](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf#protobuf-compiler-installation) - to compile protobuf files with their 3rd-party dependencies
4) [cargo deny](https://github.com/EmbarkStudios/cargo-deny) - to check for security/license/sources issues

Then for a code (re-)generation run

```sh
V4_PROTO_REBUILD=1 cargo build -vv
```

Before publishing make sure to run (and fix all warnings and errors)

```sh
cargo fmt
cargo clippy
cargo deny check licenses advisories sources
```

## Q&A

1) Why do we put autogenerated files to the crate (and git) and do not (re-)generate them at compilation?

    For several reasons:
    * reproducibility of the dependency
    * to avoid external dependencies for the lib users (`protoc` and `buf` are only needed for code generation)

    But if a user wants to (re-)generate at compilation time, he/she can set an environment variable `V4_PROTO_REBUILD` (to any value).

2) Why do I need a `protoc` for this crate development? I thought `prost-build` crate generates everything natively with Rust?

    The main work (parsing, linking, etc. - have a look https://protobuf.com/docs/descriptors) is done by `protoc`.
    The result of the `protoc` work is a "file descriptor" (think of it as IR assembly language like LLVM IR) - a binary file. This file descriptor is an input for a language-specific code generator like `prost`. Think of `prost` crate as a compiler target which generates a ISA-specific "assembly" (in our case, Rust) as an output.
    `prost-build` always used the `protoc` but since version 0.11 of [prost-build](https://github.com/tokio-rs/prost?tab=readme-ov-file#protoc) it requires `protoc` (the protobuf compiler) to be already installed on the system - before the `protoc` could be compiled during the `prost-build` build (https://github.com/tokio-rs/prost/blob/v0.10.4/prost-build/build.rs#L77).

3) Why do we use `tonic-build` crate and not just `prost-build`?

    `prost-build` generates only serialization-deserialization stubs for messages, but we also need a client implementation (generated by `tonic-build`) because packages in other language implementations of `v4-chain` have ones.

4) Why do we need `buf`?

    [Buf](https://buf.build/) is a tool whose primary function is to resolve dependencies in protobuf files. Protobuf specifications can refer to 3rd-party protobuf specifications and use types declared there. Basically, `buf` builds a list of all used protobuf files, downloads them, and allows exporting (=copying) them to a specified directory. The proto files in this repository and downloaded 3rd-party proto files (aka "includes") are an input for the `protoc`.
